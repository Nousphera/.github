We believe the future of machine learning is **decentralized** —  where intelligence grows collaboratively, **without data ever leaving its source**.  

Our mission is to **accelerate decentralized ML** and make it the **de facto paradigm** for building intelligent, efficient, and privacy-preserving systems.  

No central authority — just **collective learning**, where *everyone contributes* — safely, privately, and efficiently.

## 🧠 What We’re Building

We **push the boundaries of learning and optimization at the edge**, with research to create *scalable, efficient, and multimodal decentralized learning systems.*

### 🔍 Key Directions

- ⚡ **Federated & Split Learning** — frameworks for decentralized collaboration across heterogeneous devices and institutions.  
- 🧩 **Foundation Model Fine-Tuning** — adapting large-scale (multimodal) Foundation Models (FMs) to decentralized and resource-constrained environments.  
- 🔒 **Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms** — integrating differential privacy, encryption, and secure aggregation into multimodal FMs.  
- 🛰️ **Edge & On-Device Intelligence** — enabling lightweight, self-improving models that learn directly where data is generated.  
- 🔄 **Decentralized Optimization & Aggregation** — redefining how distributed models synchronize, exchange knowledge, and evolve without central coordination.
